See equities, combination counts, and hand value breakdowns: instantly. This Poker hand Range Calculator will help you learn flop textures, how ranges split up on boards, how equities shift on turn and river cards. A tool to learn and improve your Texas Poker Hold'em strategy.

First, we start with a preflop range.
Get started by selecting a preflop range for the scenario you are analyzing.

## Features

### Single-page app

This Calculator uses react and redux to display and pass data around very smoothly. The React opponents's possible range Grid and Slider are two different components, but work
together seamlessly. The odds are instantly calculated and displayed as a card is added to the table or the dead card grid.
